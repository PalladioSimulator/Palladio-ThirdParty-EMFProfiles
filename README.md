# emf-profiles
This is a fork of the EMF Profiles github repository for Palladio.

EMF Profiles can be seen as an adaptation of the UML profile concept to DSMLs. Profiles have been a key enabler for the success of UML by providing a lightweight language-inherent extension mechanism which is expressive enough to cover an important subset of adaptation scenarios.
